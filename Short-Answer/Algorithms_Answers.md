#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I
a) This is time complexity of O(n). The while loop looks like it could be n^3, but since a is updated with a+ n^2, some of that cancels it out.

b) Time complexity of O(n log n). Normally I'd assume nested loops are O(n^2), but since the inner loop increments with j*=2 it is O(log n). Ultimately giving this time complexity of O(n) * O(log n) = O(n log n).

c) This has a runtime complexity of O(n). As n increases, the number of recursion cycles increases linearly.
